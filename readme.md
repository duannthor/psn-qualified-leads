Objective: Log into my PSN, scrape all games I have PLAYED, store in a neo4j database.
Use the mobygames API to pull a person's game credentials (game, role).

Match the games and use a ranked ordering to see if there are any commonalities.

I'll use python, uv for pckg and venv mgmt, docker, selenium, and mobygames API
